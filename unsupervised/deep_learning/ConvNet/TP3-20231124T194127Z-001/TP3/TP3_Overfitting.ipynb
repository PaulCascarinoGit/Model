While this is happening, your model is said to be **under-fit**: there is still progress to be made; the network hasn't yet modeled all relevant patterns in the training data. But after a certain number of iterations on the training data, generalization stops improving, test metrics stall then start degrading: the model is then starting to **over-fit**. In other words, it is starting to learn patterns  that are specific to the training data but that are misleading or irrelevant when it comes to new data.\n","\n","The goal is to achieve models that get a good generalization, so as to perform well on never-before-seen data. However, you do not control generalization; you can only adjust the model based on its training data. Therefore, it’s crucial to be able to reliably measure the generalization power of your model.\n","\n","#### Training, validation, and test sets\n","\n","Evaluating a model always boils down to splitting the available data into three sets: **training**, **validation**, and **test**. You train on the training data, and evaluate your model on the validation data. Once your model is ready for prime time, you test it one final time on the test data.\n","\n","*Why do we need separate sets?* \n","\n","You should never test a machine learning model on the same data that you used to train it! Just because a model performs well on its training data doesn't mean that it will perform well on data it has never seen, and what you actually care about is your model's performance on new data (since you already know the labels of your training data, obviously you don't need your model to predict those). For instance, it is possible that your model could end up merely *memorizing* a mapping between your training samples and their targets, which would be completely useless for the task of predicting targets for data never seen before. \n","\n","*Why not have two sets: a training set and a test set?* \n","\n","You’d train on the training data and evaluate on the test data. Much simpler! The reason is that developing a model always involves tuning its configuration: for\n","example, choosing the number of layers or the size of the layers (called the hyper-parameters of the model, to distinguish them from the parameters, which are the network’s weights). You do this tuning by using as a feedback signal the performance of the model on the validation data. In essence, this tuning is a form of learning: a search\n","for a good configuration in some parameter space. As a result, tuning the configuration of the model based on its performance on the validation set can quickly result in overfitting to the validation set, even though your model is never directly trained on it.\n","\n","Central to this phenomenon is the notion of information leaks. Every time you tune a hyperparameter of your model based on the model’s performance on the validation set, some information about the validation data leaks into the model. If you do this only once, for one parameter, then very few bits of information will leak, and your validation\n","set will remain reliable to evaluate the model. But if you repeat this many times—running one experiment, evaluating on the validation set, and modifying your model as a result — then you’ll leak an increasingly significant amount of information about the validation set into the model.\n","\n","At the end of the day, you'll end up with a model that performs artificially well on the validation data, because that’s what you optimized it for. You care about performance on completely new data, not the validation data, so you need to use a completely different, never-before-seen, dataset to evaluate the model: the test set. Your model shouldn’t have had access to any information about the test set, even indirectly. If anything about the model has been tuned based on test set performance, then your measure of generalization will be flawed.\n","\n","Splitting your data into training, validation, and test sets may seem straightforward, but there are a few advanced ways to do it that can come in handy when little data is available. The two classic approaches are: *hold-out* validation, and *K-fold* validation.\n","\n","#### Things to keep in mind\n","\n","*Data representativeness* — You want both your training set and test set to be representative of the data at hand. For instance, if you’re trying to classify images of digits, and you’re starting from an array of samples where the samples are ordered by their class, taking the first 80% of the array as your training set and the remaining 20% as your test set will result in your training set containing only classes 0-7, whereas your test set contains only classes 8–9. This seems like a ridiculous mistake, but it’s surprisingly common. For this reason, you usually should randomly shuffle your data before splitting it into training and test sets.\n","\n","*The arrow of time* — If you’re trying to predict the future given the past (for example, tomorrow’s weather, stock movements, and so on), you should not randomly shuffle your data before splitting it, because doing so will create a temporal leak: your model will effectively be trained on data from the future. In such situations, you should always make sure all data in your test set is posterior to the data in the training set.\n","\n","*Redundancy in your data* — If some data points in your data appear twice (fairly common with real-world data), then shuffling the data, and splitting it into a training set and a validation set will result in redundancy between the training and validation sets. In effect, you’ll be testing on part of your training data, which is the worst thing you can do! Make sure your training set and validation set are disjoint."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DZAlh_UiVnQd"},"source":["# 1.

How to fight against over-fitting\n","\n","In the previous example, we could notice that the performance of our model on the test data peaked after a few epochs, and then started degrading. This clearly indicated that our model *overfitted* to the training data. The problem of overfitting happens in every single machine learning task. Learning how to deal with overfitting is essential to mastering machine learning. \n","\n","To prevent a model from over-fitting (i.e., learning misleading or irrelevant patterns found in the training data), the best solution is to *get more training data*. A model trained on more data will naturally generalize better. When that is no longer possible, the next best solution is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add constraints on what information it is allowed to store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n","\n","The process of fighting overfitting in this way is called *regularization*. Let's review some of the most common regularization techniques, and let's apply them in practice to improve our movie classification model from the previous tutorial."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TuFO_EfXVnRY"},"source":["## 2.1 Reducing the network's size\n","\n","The simplest way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the model, i.e. the number of learnable parameters in the model (which is determined by the number of layers and the number of units per layer). In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is often referred to as the model's \"capacity\". Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any generalization power. For instance, a model with 500,000 binary parameters could easily be made to learn the class of every digits in the \n","MNIST training set: we would only need 10 binary parameters for each of the 50,000 digits. Such a model would be useless for classifying new digit samples. Always keep this in mind: deep learning models tend to be good at fitting to the training data, but the real challenge is generalization, not fitting.\n","\n","On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn this mapping as easily, and thus, in order to minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power regarding the targets -- precisely the type of representations that we are interested in. At the same time, keep in mind that you should be using models that have enough parameters that they won't be underfitting: your model shouldn't be starved for memorization resources. There is a compromise to be found between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\".\n","\n","Unfortunately, there is no magical formula to determine what the right number of layers is, or what the right size for each layer is. You will have to evaluate an array of different architectures (on your validation set, not on your test set), in order to find the right model size for your data. The general workflow to find an appropriate model size is to start with relatively few layers and parameters, and start increasing the size of the layers or adding new layers until you see diminishing returns with regard to the validation loss.\n","\n","Let's try this on our movie review classification network.

Let's say a given layer would normally have returned a vector `[0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1]` for a \n","given input sample during training; after applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random, e.g. `[0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]`. The \"dropout rate\" is the fraction of the features that are being zeroed-out; it is usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no units are dropped out, and instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, so as to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time.\n","\n","This technique may seem strange and arbitrary. Why would this help reduce overfitting?
